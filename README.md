## Project Vihara: QR Scanning App

This application was developed as part of the 72-hour online hackathon HaxPlore CodeFest 2024 conducted by IIT BHU, Varanasi.

### About

Vihara is a modern ticketing system for seamless access to temples. Users can book tickets for darshans/pujas at convenient slots and make donations to the temple via various secure payment gateways. A booking ID and QR code is generated for each payment made, for seamless and secure payment/ entry confirmation, enabling temples to track variables such as number of visitors, waiting times, etc. 

This repository contains the QR Scanning App for our project built using React Native Expo. Temple authorities scan the QR generated upon payment by Users, and booking made is validated.
